Hi.

I got bored from not too many work from office but from life. So I decided to send my ass back to 2008 and work from that environment.
I am currently working as Frontend Developer in Jurno.id, stuff I will share here will fulfill the needs, or atleast my needs working from Windows XP Professional x64.
Send me an email in mhabibillah17@gmail.com if you got any questions, don't hesitate.
